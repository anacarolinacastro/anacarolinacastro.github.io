## The context

In fact, computers only knows about numbers. When configured in networks, the computer can be reached by others using a defined IP (Internet Protocol). Currently, there are two IP versions, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the most known version, it looks like **172.217.29.78** and in each field we can fave decimal numbers from 0 to 255. But as the number of devices are growing the number of public [IPv4 are running out](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/internet-now-officially-too-big-ip-addresses-run-out-n386081). In order to fix this issue, the IETF developed a new version of this protocol, the IPv6. The IPv6 has the format is like **2800:3f0:4004:808::200e**, where we have 6 blocks containing up to 4 digits hexadecimal values.


Suppose we want to access Google website and to access it we have to reach the server 172.217.162.174 at the port 80 (HTTP) and for any other website we want to access we would have to know its IP address like this. It would be horrible to remember the IP address for each website. Luckly, a name resolution protocol known as DNS was created. DNS stands for Domain Name System and works as the contact list of the internet. The DNS server holds the DNS zones configurations, that way the clients can lookup the domain wanted. For example, the user types `google.com` and hit enter. Then the browser uses the configured DNS server to look for the IP that the domain responds to and load the web content.

 <!-- User type URL -> Browser asks DNS -> DNS Server answer -> Browser loads -->

<!-- root servers -->

## The specification

### DNS structure

The smallest part of a DNS structure it the record. To define a record it must provide a name, a type and a content.

<!-- formats -->
<!-- zone settings: TTL  -->
<!-- zones > records > -->

#### DNS Types Overview

Between the many records types, there are some that are most used and worth to know.

| Type | Usage |
|-------|---|
| NS | specifies an authoritative name server for the zone |
| SOA | information of the authority zone |
| A | a hostname represent its IPv4 Address |
| AAAA | a hostname represent its IPv6 Address |
| PTR | the reverse of the hostname, meaning that the host is the |
| CNAME | a hostname that has another hostname | <!-- (different than a redirect) -->
| TXT | a hostname that has string as content |
| MX | mailing exchange |


## The tools

There are a lot of command line tools that can be used for DNS lookup. But the most used are `host`, `dig` and `nslookup`. Let's see some usage examples.


### 1) dig

First, let's pretend that we want to find out the name servers (the `NS` record type) for a domain, whe can use the `host` tool passing the DNS type with the `-t` flag.

```
$ dig -t NS globo.com

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> -t NS globo.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 26526
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 512
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;globo.com.			IN	NS

;; ANSWER SECTION:
globo.com.		14649	IN	NS	ns04.globo.com.
globo.com.		14649	IN	NS	ns01.globo.com.
globo.com.		14649	IN	NS	ns02.globo.com.
globo.com.		14649	IN	NS	ns03.globo.com.

;; Query time: 72 msec
;; SERVER: 8.8.4.4#53(8.8.4.4)
;; WHEN: Wed Jan 15 21:50:17 -03 2020
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 114
```

We can also use the `+short` flag to get a direct answer.

```
$ dig +short -t NS globo.com
ns04.globo.com.
ns02.globo.com.
ns01.globo.com.
ns03.globo.com.
```

Now that we know the name servers that own the `globo.com` zone configuration, we can lookup a host directly to it by providing the DNS server after the `@` symbol. The benefit of doing this, is to skip the cached DNS at the internet servers. For the people that administer DNS servers, this is a very useful trick.

```
$ dig +short -t A globoplay.globo.com @ns1.globo.com
131.0.25.109
```

Let's try to get the mailing exchange info from `globo.com`.


```
$ dig +short -t MX globo.com
10 mx2.globo.locaweb.com.br.
5 mx.globo.locaweb.com.br.
20 mx3.globo.locaweb.com.br.
```

### 2) nslookup

As done previously with the `dig` command, let's find out the name servers from `globo.com`. The command usage is similar, but the output has a different format.

```
$ nslookup -type=NS globo.com
Server:		8.8.4.4
Address:	8.8.4.4#53

Non-authoritative answer:
globo.com	nameserver = ns04.globo.com.
globo.com	nameserver = ns01.globo.com.
globo.com	nameserver = ns02.globo.com.
globo.com	nameserver = ns03.globo.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:
```

### 3) host

Again, lets fetch the name server for `globo.com`, but with `host` command this time.

```
$ host -t NS globo.com
globo.com name server ns04.globo.com.
globo.com name server ns01.globo.com.
globo.com name server ns02.globo.com.
globo.com name server ns03.globo.com.
```


Now that we know the name server that responds for `globo.com`, let's check a `A` record from that zone.
